# Contributing

Contributions are wholly encouraged, and we eagerly await any additions you may wish to make. There are relatively few things to consider before submittng a pull request:

- We are shifting toward eslint's AirBNB style guide. Please try adhering to that standard when adding to the code.
- Make sure to document the functions and uses for any additions you make. Additionally, make sure to create unit tests for any any new functions, utiliizing mocha/chai.

# Roadmap

Most major roadmap items will be added to the [issues page](https://github.com/arnoldlee850807/Movie-Recommender/issues), but our primary next steps are:

- Creating bespoke recommendation algorithms for more accurate recommendations. Specifically, using either an internal account system, or pulling from a user's external account (on IMDB, LetterBoxd, etc.) to better refine recommendations to a user's tastes.
- Improving the interface with Vue/Beaufy.
- Integrate links to external streaming services in search results.
- Create further integration with the browser experience, like being able to select movie names in a webpage, and search that way.
